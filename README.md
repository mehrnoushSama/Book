# What is this project?
This project is a test to display two pages of the Gajino application, which includes a splash page and a book detail page that receives book information from API and then displays it.

# Architecture 
MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component. Most importantly, in this architecture, the children don't have the direct reference to the parent, they only have the reference by observables.
